Within terraform code, each individual resource can have its own
"provisioner" defining the connection method (if required such as SSH or WinRM)
and the actions/commands or script to execute.

There are 2 types of provisioners which you can set the run when a resource is created/destroyed:
 1. Creation-time 
 2. Destroy-time

Terrafom es declarativo, asi que no trackea los provisioners
